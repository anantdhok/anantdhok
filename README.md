### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an AI enthusiast and front-end developer whoâ€™s passionate about building thoughtful, intuitive experiences â€” from full-stack applications to sleek, interactive interfaces.

ðŸ’» I work with technologies like React (Next.js, CRA), C++, Python, and TypeScript/JavaScript (MERN). On the design side, I love crafting smooth UIs using Tailwind CSS, Material UI, SASS, and Framer Motion. Iâ€™m also a self-taught graphic designer. Whether itâ€™s Figma or Adobe Suite, I enjoy designing clean, memorable visuals that make an impact.

ðŸ”­ Currently at pi-labs, Iâ€™m helping build a secure future for truth on the internet. Most of my time goes into front-end development, interface design, and algorithmic thinking.

ðŸŒ± Right now, Iâ€™m diving deeper into front-end architectures and exploring how AI models are shaping the future of the web. I'm always up for interesting collaborations, creative challenges, or just nerding out over good UI. Letâ€™s connect!
